# Balanced K-Means clustering in PyTorch

# Credits
This implementation extends the package `kmeans_pytorch` which contains the
implementation of the original Lloyd's K-means algorithm in Pytorch. You can check (and star!)
the original package [here](https://github.com/subhadarship/kmeans_pytorch).


For licensing of this project, please refer to this repo as well as the `kmeans_pytorch` repo.
